# Data


'Churn' — the fact of churn for the month in question<br>
Current dataset fields: <br>
User data for the preceding month<br>
'gender' <br>
'Near_Location' — whether the user lives or works in the neighborhood where the gym is located<br>
'Partner' — whether the user is an employee of a partner company (the gym has partner companies whose employees get discounts; in those cases the gym stores information on customers' employers)<br>
Promo_friends — whether the user originally signed up through a "bring a friend" offer (they used a friend's promo code when paying for their first membership) <br>
'Phone' — whether the user provided their phone number<br>
'Age' <br> 
'Lifetime' — the time (in months) since the customer first came to the gym <br>
Data from the log of visits and purchases and data on current membership status<br>
'Contract_period' — 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year <br>
'Month_to_end_contract' — the months remaining until the contract expires<br>
'Group_visits' — whether the user takes part in group sessions <br>
'Avg_class_frequency_total' — average frequency of visits per week over the customer's lifetime<br>

'Avg_additional_charges_total' — the total amount of money spent on other gym services: cafe, athletic goods, cosmetics, massages, etc.<br>

# Goal:
The aim of the project is to develope a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data for gym chain Model Fitness. We will develope a model for predicting the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer.<br>
